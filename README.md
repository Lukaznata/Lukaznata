# 👋 Hi there! Welcome to my GitHub

My name is [Your Name], and my journey in tech started in a pretty interesting way — I tried to build a website for my brother. That experience sparked something in me, and I realized I’ve always enjoyed working with computers and solving problems. That’s when I knew I had found my path.

Today, I focus on both **front-end and back-end development**, working to build complete, well-structured applications. I'm also diving into areas like **application monitoring**, best practices, and performance optimization.

## 🚀 Technologies and Tools I Use

- **Front-end**: React.js, Next.js, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, Styled-Components, Tailwind
- **Back-end**: Node.js, Express, Sequelize, Mongoose, JWT, REST APIs
- **Databases**: MySQL, MongoDB
- **Others**: Docker, GitHub Actions, AWS (basic), Postman, Figma, Jest, React Testing Library

## 💡 What Drives Me

I love turning ideas into real solutions, tackling technical challenges, and constantly learning. Whether it’s debugging, refactoring code, or improving performance — I enjoy the process because every detail matters when it comes to building great software.
